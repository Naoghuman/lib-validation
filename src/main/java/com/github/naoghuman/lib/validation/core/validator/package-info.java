 * Contains the validators from the library {@code Lib-Validation}.
 * <p>
 * On the one side that's are validators for the annotations from the 
 * package {@code com.github.naoghuman.lib.validation.core.annotation} 
 * and a {@link com.github.naoghuman.lib.validation.core.validator.PreConditionValidator}
 * which have many useful methods to validate the momentary state from an object.
 * <br>
 * At last there is also the class {@link com.github.naoghuman.lib.validation.core.validator.ValidationFactory} 
 * which allowed the access to a {@link javax.validation.Validator} which can be 
 * used to validate annotated attributes.
